# Organizations

**Protocol:** JSON 1.1 (`X-Amz-Target: AWSOrganizationsV20161128.*`)
**Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:4566/`

Floci emulates the full AWS Organizations control plane: the organization and its root,
the organizational-unit tree, member accounts, policies of every type, tags, trusted
service access, delegated administrators, the organization resource policy, and the
invitation/handshake flow.

## Accounts are real Floci accounts

Floci resolves any 12-digit access key id straight to an AWS account, so an account created
by `CreateAccount` is immediately usable as a caller identity against every other service:

```bash
aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 organizations create-organization --feature-set ALL
aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 organizations create-account \
    --email dev@example.com --account-name Dev
# ... then call as that account
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<new-account-id> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=x \
  aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 organizations describe-organization
```

## Management account vs member accounts

Authorization mirrors AWS. Every mutating action is restricted to the **management account**
— the account that called `CreateOrganization` — and returns `AccessDeniedException` otherwise.
Member accounts can read the organization they belong to (`DescribeOrganization`, `ListRoots`,
`ListParents`, `DescribeAccount`, `DescribePolicy`), act on handshakes addressed to them, and
call `LeaveOrganization`. An account in no organization gets
`AWSOrganizationsNotInUseException`.

## Behaviour notes

- The AWS-managed `p-FullAWSAccess` SCP is created with the organization and attached to the
  root, every new OU and every new account. Detaching the last service control policy from a
  target is rejected with `ConstraintViolationException`, as on AWS.
- A `CONSOLIDATED_BILLING` organization has no available policy types. `EnableAllFeatures`
  promotes it to `ALL`; with no member accounts the handshake completes immediately. With member
  accounts it stays `REQUESTED` until one of them calls `AcceptHandshake` — AWS requires *every*
  member to approve, which Floci simplifies to the first acceptance.
- `CreateAccount` returns a `CreateAccountStatus` you can poll with
  `DescribeCreateAccountStatus`, matching the asynchronous AWS contract. A duplicate email
  produces `State=FAILED` with `FailureReason=EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS` rather than an error.
- `DescribeEffectivePolicy` merges every policy of the requested type down the
  root → OU → target chain, with the closest ancestor winning on conflicting keys. As on AWS,
  the access-control types (`SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY`, `RESOURCE_CONTROL_POLICY`) are rejected.
- Handshakes expire 15 days after they are created and report `EXPIRED` from then on.
- Organizations ARNs are global and carry no region:
  `arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:organization/o-abc1234567`.

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ORGANIZATIONS_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables the service |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ORGANIZATIONS_SCP_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED` | `false` | When `true` (and IAM enforcement is enabled), attached service control policies participate in IAM policy evaluation |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ORGANIZATIONS_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` | unset | Email reported for the organization's management account (`DescribeOrganization` master account, `ListAccounts`). Unset falls back to the built-in default |
| `FLOCI_STORAGE_SERVICES_ORGANIZATIONS_MODE` | inherits `FLOCI_STORAGE_MODE` | Storage mode override |
| `FLOCI_STORAGE_SERVICES_ORGANIZATIONS_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS` | `5000` | Hybrid/WAL flush interval |

## SCP enforcement

With `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED=true` and
`FLOCI_SERVICES_ORGANIZATIONS_SCP_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED=true`, service control policies attached to
the root, OUs, and accounts participate in IAM policy evaluation: an action must be allowed at every
level of the account's chain, before the caller's identity policies are consulted. SCPs never grant
permissions on their own. See
[Service Control Policies (SCPs)](iam.md#service-control-policies-scps) for the evaluation order,
the account-root behaviour, and the cases that bypass enforcement.

The evaluation itself lives in the IAM enforcement layer — this service stores the policies and
resolves the chain, but with IAM enforcement off the flag has no effect.

## Example
