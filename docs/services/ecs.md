# ECS (Elastic Container Service)

**Protocol:** JSON 1.1
**Endpoint:** `POST /` + `X-Amz-Target: AmazonEC2ContainerServiceV20141113.<Action>`

ECS emulates clusters, task definitions, tasks, and services. In the default configuration tasks run as real Docker containers. Set `mock: true` (enabled automatically in tests) to run tasks as in-process stubs without Docker.

## Supported Operations

### Clusters

| Operation | Description |
|---|---|
| `CreateCluster` | Create a cluster (idempotent) |
| `DescribeClusters` | Describe one or more clusters |
| `ListClusters` | List cluster ARNs |
| `UpdateCluster` | Update cluster settings |
| `UpdateClusterSettings` | Update `containerInsights` and other settings |
| `PutClusterCapacityProviders` | Associate capacity providers with a cluster |
| `DeleteCluster` | Delete an empty cluster |

### Task Definitions

| Operation | Description |
|---|---|
| `RegisterTaskDefinition` | Register a new revision of a task definition |
| `DescribeTaskDefinition` | Describe a task definition by family:revision or ARN |
| `ListTaskDefinitions` | List task definition ARNs |
| `ListTaskDefinitionFamilies` | List task definition family names |
| `DeregisterTaskDefinition` | Mark a revision INACTIVE |
| `DeleteTaskDefinitions` | Delete one or more task definitions |

`runtimePlatform` and a container's `logConfiguration` are stored and returned exactly as
registered, so a client that reads back what it wrote (Terraform, or a deploy tool verifying its
own `RegisterTaskDefinition`) sees no drift. Neither changes how a local task runs: Floci launches
every task on the host's own architecture, and a task's output stays with its Docker container
rather than being routed to the configured log driver.

### Tasks

| Operation | Description |
|---|---|
| `RunTask` | Launch one or more task instances |
| `StartTask` | Start a task on specific container instances |
| `StopTask` | Stop a running task |
| `DescribeTasks` | Describe one or more tasks |
| `ListTasks` | List task ARNs (filterable by cluster, family, service, status) |
| `UpdateTaskProtection` | Set scale-in protection for tasks |
| `GetTaskProtection` | Get current task protection state |

### Services

| Operation | Description |
|---|---|
| `CreateService` | Create a long-running service |
| `UpdateService` | Update desired count, task definition, or deployment config |
| `DeleteService` | Delete a service (supports `force`) |
| `DescribeServices` | Describe one or more services (includes `deployments`, see below) |
| `ListServices` | List service ARNs in a cluster |
| `ListServicesByNamespace` | List services filtered by Cloud Map namespace |

#### Service deployments

An `ACTIVE` service reports exactly one `PRIMARY` entry in `services[].deployments`,
synthesized from the service's current state rather than tracked as a rollout. This is
what AWS's `ServicesStable` waiter accepts on, so `aws ecs wait services-stable`, the
SDK waiters, and Terraform's `aws_ecs_service` all converge normally. A deleted
(`INACTIVE`) service reports an empty list.

`rolloutState` is `COMPLETED` once `runningCount` reaches `desiredCount`, and
`IN_PROGRESS` before that. The deployment `id` is derived from the service ARN and its
task definition, so it is stable across calls and across restarts, and rolls over when
the task definition changes. `createdAt` tracks the deployment rather than the service:
it is the service's creation time until a task-definition change starts a new
deployment, and moves with it thereafter.

Known differences from AWS:

- There is never a second `ACTIVE` deployment draining alongside the `PRIMARY` one.
  The running tasks *are* rolled onto a changed task definition (replacements on the new
  revision start first, then the stale tasks are drained, one reconciler tick apart), but
  the deployments list reports only the single `PRIMARY` throughout.
- `deployments` is reported for every service. AWS omits it for services that use the
  `CODE_DEPLOY` or `EXTERNAL` deployment controller; Floci records and echoes
  `deploymentController` (along with `schedulingStrategy` and
  `availabilityZoneRebalancing`; AWS defaults `ECS` / `REPLICA` / `ENABLED` on create) but
  still synthesises the `deployments` list regardless of the controller type.
- `DAEMON` scheduling runs exactly one task per `ACTIVE` container instance and derives
  `desiredCount` from that count; it is rejected for the Fargate launch type and for the
  `CODE_DEPLOY` / `EXTERNAL` controllers, as on AWS. Placement constraints are not evaluated.
- `pendingCount` is always `0`, matching the top-level service field.
- `forceNewDeployment` (with an unchanged task definition) mints a new deployment `id`
  and rolls the running tasks: a replacement on the new deployment starts first, then
  the task from the previous deployment is drained one reconciler tick later. The
  `deployments` list still reports a single `PRIMARY` throughout.
- `updatedAt` equals `createdAt`. AWS advances it as a rollout progresses; Floci has no
  intermediate rollout state to report.

#### ECS EventBridge events

Floci publishes AWS-shaped lifecycle events to the **default** EventBridge bus
(`source: aws.ecs`). Rules matching `aws.ecs` fire from ECS activity, in both docker
and mock mode.

| `detail-type` | When | Key `detail` fields |
|---|---|---|
| `ECS Task State Change` | a task starts or stops | `lastStatus`, `desiredStatus`, `taskDefinitionArn`, `group`, `startedBy`, `stoppedReason`, `containers[].exitCode` |
| `ECS Deployment State Change` | a service deployment starts, is in progress, or reaches steady state | `eventType` (always `INFO`), `eventName`, `deploymentId` |

`eventName` is one of `SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT_STARTED`, `SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS`,
`SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETED`.

Known differences from AWS:

- The task phase ladder is **synthesized**. Floci's task model only occupies
  `PENDING`, `RUNNING` and `STOPPED`, but a start emits
  `PROVISIONING -> PENDING -> ACTIVATING -> RUNNING` and a stop emits
  `DEACTIVATING -> STOPPING -> DEPROVISIONING -> STOPPED`, one `ECS Task State Change`
  per phase, so rules that filter on `detail.lastStatus` behave as on AWS.
- `SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT_FAILED` and the deployment circuit breaker are not emitted.
- `SubmitTaskStateChange` / `SubmitContainerStateChange` remain ACK-only; Floci drives
  the task lifecycle itself rather than via agent submissions.

#### Unknown services

A service reference that does not resolve is returned in `failures` with
`reason: MISSING` and the ARN the service would have had, rather than being dropped from
the response. `DescribeServices` therefore returns partial results instead of erroring, as
AWS does, and `aws ecs wait services-stable` on a nonexistent service fails immediately
instead of polling for its full timeout. A reference supplied as an ARN is echoed back
unchanged.

### Task Sets

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable the ECS service |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_MOCK` | `false` | Skip Docker; tasks go straight to `RUNNING` (useful for CI) |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_DOCKER_NETWORK` | *(unset)* | Docker network for task containers |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_TASK_NETWORK_MODE` | `shared` | `shared` or `per-container`; see [Task network namespace](#task-network-namespace) |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_DEFAULT_MEMORY_MB` | `512` | Default memory (MB) when the task definition omits it |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_DEFAULT_CPU_UNITS` | `256` | Default CPU units when the task definition omits it |

### Task network namespace

On Fargate, and in `awsvpc` network mode generally, every container of a task shares one network
namespace: a sidecar reaches its neighbour on `127.0.0.1`, and the task has a single IP with one
set of ports. Floci reproduces that by letting the first container definition own the namespace and
creating the task's other containers with Docker's `container:<id>` network mode. Port publishing,
DNS and `/etc/hosts` entries stay on the owner, which Docker requires; each container keeps its
`floci-ecs-<taskId>-<container>` name, its own log stream and its own `docker exec` health check.

`FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_TASK_NETWORK_MODE=per-container` restores the older behaviour, where every
container is a Docker container with its own IP on the task network and loopback between the
containers of a task does not work. The setting is ignored for `bridge` and `host` task
definitions, which do not share a namespace on AWS either, and for single-container tasks.

### EFS volume ownership

A task's `efsVolumeConfiguration` volumes are backed by shared local Docker volumes (Floci cannot mount a real EFS file system). A Docker named volume is created `root:root 0755`, so a task whose image runs as a non-root `USER` cannot write it. To emulate an [EFS access point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html)'s `RootDirectory.CreationInfo` and `PosixUser`, configure `floci.storage.efs.*` (all opt-in; the default is a plain named volume, so existing behaviour is unchanged):

| Key (`floci.storage.efs.`) | Env | AWS equivalent | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `owner-uid` | `FLOCI_STORAGE_EFS_OWNER_UID` | `CreationInfo.OwnerUid` | Owner uid of the volume root (set together with `owner-gid`) |
| `owner-gid` | `FLOCI_STORAGE_EFS_OWNER_GID` | `CreationInfo.OwnerGid` | Owner gid of the volume root (set together with `owner-uid`) |
| `root-permissions` | `FLOCI_STORAGE_EFS_ROOT_PERMISSIONS` | `CreationInfo.Permissions` | 3-4 octal digits, e.g. `0777`, or `2775` for the setgid bit |
| `mount-user` | `FLOCI_STORAGE_EFS_MOUNT_USER` | `PosixUser {Uid,Gid}` | Run mounting containers as `uid[:gid]` |
| `mount-group-add` | `FLOCI_STORAGE_EFS_MOUNT_GROUP_ADD` | `PosixUser` supplementary | Supplementary gid added to mounting containers |
| `init-image` | `FLOCI_STORAGE_EFS_INIT_IMAGE` | — | Image for the one-off `chown`/`chmod` of the volume root (default `busybox:stable`) |

`owner-uid` and `owner-gid` must be set together (a partial `CreationInfo` is not valid on AWS). The volume root is initialised once per volume; express the setgid bit through a 4-digit `root-permissions` (e.g. `2775`) so subdirectories inherit the owner gid.

### Mock mode

Set `FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_MOCK=true` to run without Docker. In this mode tasks skip container launch and immediately transition to `RUNNING`, then to `STOPPED` when stopped. This is the recommended mode for unit/integration tests and CI pipelines where Docker-in-Docker is unavailable.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml — CI / test environment
services:
  floci:
    image: floci/floci:latest
    environment:
      FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_MOCK: "true"
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml — local development (real containers)
services:
  floci:
    image: floci/floci:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_MOCK: "false"
      FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_DOCKER_NETWORK: my_network
```

### Docker socket requirement

When `mock: false` (the default), ECS launches real Docker containers and requires the Docker socket. Mount it and set the network so containers can reach each other. For private registry authentication and other Docker settings see [Docker Configuration](../configuration/docker.md).

```yaml
services:
  floci:
    image: floci/floci:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      FLOCI_SERVICES_ECS_DOCKER_NETWORK: aws-local_default
```
